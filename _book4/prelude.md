Beloveds of Heaven,

How much joy there is today in all creation! It is the joy we all share when we
unite with you.

Oh humanity! If you had but an idea of how blessed are these dialogues of
Divine Love, and how much we love those who live in the light of the living
Christ, you would cry of happiness.

I am Archangel Raphael. I have come by divine design to serve. I thank you all,
including you, the scribe from Heaven, for allowing me to collaborate in your
lives.

I have come into your presence to give shape, in union and relationship, to
this fourth book of this miraculous work. Through it, wisdom extends to the
whole world, uniting in spirit and truth with all that is holy, beautiful, and
perfect.

Before beginning the various sessions of this book, I would like to remind you
that you are worthy children of God. Your dignity is such that a word cannot be
conceived in your language that could express the greatness of your self. You
are beloved children of God. You are redeemed humanity, perfect expressions
of divine mercy. What one day was, is no longer, because it has never truly
been. Now the new becomes reality in your self. You are the new humanity reborn
in Christ.

My friends! Remember that I am closer to you than your own breath. I will
always be by your side because you and I are one. In our equality lies the
truth of who we are; I am not superior to you, nor to anyone.

In the realm of love there is no such thing as superiority or inferiority. No
idea of separation is true. What I am is part of you, you are part of me, and
we all are part of the Christ of God. We are creation, extending. We are unity
of self.
