## I. Free as the Wind

Love is not of the world, although love may manifest in it. Likewise,
what you are is not of the world, although you can be expressed in it.
Extending God’s love in the world is both possible and necessary. It is
possible because I already demonstrated it. This demonstration was not
only beautifully carried out two thousand years ago, but there was
never a moment when my love was not visible in temporal reality.

It is necessary to share Divine Love here, now, and forever, because if
you do not share the love you are, you are not giving yourself, and if
you do not give yourself, you cannot know yourself fully. Remember:
you reach the fullness of being by giving yourself.

Your ability to give yourself cannot be limited by anything external.
The world cannot impose limits on being, nor on its expression. Only you
can deny yourself and try to prove to others that you are not who you
are. Beyond that, nothing can be done with the self and its expression.
This truth is a source of wisdom and is liberating.

It would be meaningless to believe that God created your being with the
possibility of living in a universe that could annul it. Nothing can
prevent you from being who you really are. Nothing can limit you. You
are the child of God and cannot be anything else, wherever you are and
regardless of what you believe.

Surely you can forge a personality, but your personality is not your
being. The proof of this is that personalities change. Anything not
subject to the law of immutability is not part of you—in other words,
you are the eternal in you. This is not mere metaphysics or philosophy;
it is the simple truth about who you are. The definitions about yourself
which you have long harbored may have no relation to the truth about
your Christ identity, or may be a little closer. No matter. Every
definition of your divine reality is false, for what you are cannot be
defined. All we can do is give you an approach to love.

That being is beyond definition is an obstacle for the thinking mind,
which constantly seeks to capture truth within its mental language. This
is a matter is of great importance. We want to make this clear before
the end of this great work of love whose goal is to take you to the
happy recognition of the being that you really are, so that you live in
accord with it and reach the fullness of love.

Perhaps when touring this work or many others that I have inspired, you
have wondered why so many words are offered to say what cannot be
explained. Or why so many symbols have been used for what is beyond what
can be symbolized. Let us answer that question.

The existence of so many words trying to give shape to formless divine
truth allows you to understand the vastness of your being, and that you
have been traveling a path of limited language which can never reveal
what God is. By experiencing that limitation, sometimes you feel
frustration. Your anger needs to be recognized. Why? Because fear of not
being able to understand what is, is the source of all anger, all
fear.

Here we are touching the deepest fibers of your human experience in
relation to the divinity that you are. If a mind feels safe only when it
can explain things on its own terms, there is no room for mystery. This
way of conceiving things which the thinking mind uses is a great
limitation, because if the mind believes that the only thing that is
real is what it can understand with its conditional logic, then what is
beyond its logic will cause fear. Fear will engender conflict because of
its desire to exclude that part of reality which it cannot understand.

Is it not true that sometimes fear abates when you understand
something? The association of the thinking mind with certainty is
widespread in the world. This is because you know that understanding is
part of love. And you know perfectly that what cannot be understood
cannot be loved. This is not an inconvenience. The problem lies in what
you have done with it.

Love and knowledge go hand in hand. But what is not linked to truth is
the desire to live in a reality where there is no mystery. God is the
Mystery of mysteries; your being is as well. Mystery, even though it
cannot be known, need not be cause for fear, even though it has been for
centuries. In fact it is the basis of all fear. What scares you is that
God, and His mystical dimension, cannot be encompassed. The same goes
for you.

All fear is ultimately fear of yourself. You have no idea of the energy
wasted by a mind that constantly tries to define itself and everything.
This is the cause of human frustration which manifests in multiple ways.

## II. Fly

You know what you are. There is no doubt about that because you know
that you are alive. Of this there is no question. And yet, you know that
life is something greater than language can express, and so in the depth
of your mind you feel an enormous tension, because you cannot express
clearly as you would want to express.

If you understand well what is being said, you will realize the basis of
anger and disease, particularly of many mental conditions. Meanings
attempted to be expressed that are not create an energy that, if not
integrated into the being, accumulates and can make the physical body
sick because it has separated itself from the reality of being.

Remember that anger, disease, and any other condition contrary to
fullness is a vital force separated from being. So, bringing these
forces together with the essence of who you are, that is, taking them
back home, is the means for healing and restoring humanity. While this
truth is simple, as always happens with what comes from God, it has been
overlooked by non-acceptance of the mystery of life.

Life is mystery, and it will be so forever. This is not because there is
a part of it immersed in unfathomable chasms, as if some of life were
hiding from you. If you remember that life and love are the same, and
that you are love and nothing but love, you will understand why you have
had so much conflict with life, love, and yourself. That conflict arose
from trying to know what cannot be known, trying to put into words what
is beyond words. This attempt is a clear sign of the non-acceptance of
mystery.

You have been fearing the mystical aspect of your reality. In truth,
there is still a very small trace of that fear, or rather the memory of
that fear. Today is the day you will leave it aside forever, because you
have been willing to become aware of it and in doing so have
reintegrated it into the love of your heart. This fear usually manifests
itself as fear of the future, or of rising to such heights that you fear
a fall.

Once you join me, you reintegrate into the reality of love and in doing
so you remain one with the truth about who you are which, in turn,
unites you to the mystery of God—a reality so immense that compared to
it, the physical universe is a grain of sand in the palm of your hand.
In our union you experience that vastness of the being that you are,
which is literally unattainable. While knowing yourself within the
unfathomable reality of truth makes you jump for joy because of its
degree of freedom and breadth, at the same time the mind tends to
retreat to the small cave of personality, where one day it felt safe,
even though it obviously was not.

“Do not rise so much,” is the litany of the ego, something like a last
scream from the little mouse of the separated self to the unfathomable
ocean of wisdom and perfect love. Without doubt your ego is no longer
active. And without doubt the thought pattern of having to strive to be
so human that you cannot be divine will vanish as soon as you recognize
it and decide to leave that pattern behind.

You are as mystical as the greatest mystic in history. You are as divine
as God Herself. You have everything that the Creator of eternal life and
love is. Is to accept this to rise so much as to be dangerously
elevated? Will others seek to knock you down from the heights? Are you
afraid of falling? Wouldn’t it be safer to stay on level ground? History
is full of tragic heroes, both those who sought to exalt their ego, and
those who wholeheartedly sought to share their elevated being so that
others would dare to fly.

## III. We Are the Ineffable

As if you had been sailing for years through stormy seas, you have
arrived here alone but with a voice in the background that sounded
like the wind and crashing waves saying repeatedly, “You can’t. Don’t
even try to get to Heaven now. Leave that for the saints.” It should not
be surprising that although you have reached this blessed port full of
light and truth, and you know that you are already in Heaven, that you
also have a habit of thinking about yourself as insignificant.

Be glad for this. Give thanks to your mind, body, and spirit for those
panic attacks or feelings of vertigo, episodes of disorientation,
painfulness in the neck, head, and back, and the ailments that prevent
you from walking easily and moving gracefully. All this is part of the
fading of the final pattern of thought and emotional response to times
of struggle. It is a blessed manifestation of the awareness of
posttraumatic shock being healed. Worry not, for it will soon be
forgotten forever.

You were created with wings. You have often been told this. Now it is
time to accept this truth. The wings with which angels have often been
represented attempt to show this true quality of your being. Only those
with wings can rise above the Earth and walk on high, yet without
leaving the reality of the universe in which they fly. In other words,
it is up to you to live on high as do the eagles. Become aware that your
thoughts can—and indeed should—be as high as those of Christ, because
your true mind is that of God. Remember that God is the mind in which
you really think. The other is not thought at all. Therefore, increas-
ingly raising your gaze without fear that your wings will melt for
coming too close to the sun, is the kind of spiritual attitude that you
are invited to master.

<div markdown="1" class="statement over-indent">

Do not settle for little when you have been given so much in<br>
<span class="over-indent">which to rejoice.</span><br>
Do not feel satisfied with the low when you have been<br>
<span class="over-indent">created to live in the heights.</span><br>
Do not accept compromise, for your being will not feel<br>
<span class="over-indent">comfortable with it.</span><br>
Be sure to unravel the eternal mysteries of love, because<br>
<span class="over-indent">otherwise your heart will suffer.</span><br>
Elevate your flight to the ends of eternity.<br>
Push yourself more and more towards the high peaks of<br>
<span class="over-indent">perfect knowledge.</span><br>
Allow the magnificence of your flight be seen in all its<br>
<span class="over-indent">beauty, so that whoever looks at you is encouraged to</span><br>
<span class="over-indent">undertake flight.</span>

</div>

My child, soul in love, see that your flight, unlike the eagles who can
tire, is like the flight of the wind that always blows and can never be
stopped, a wind that brings life yet from whence it comes and where it
goes nobody knows, whose movement is a holiness that purifies and
refreshes, a bliss that cleanses and renews, a power of movement, a
miracle of the Creator.

Be not afraid of heights. Be not afraid of falling, for you cannot. What
you are now cannot be pulled down by gravity. What you are encompasses
the reality of creation, just as God encompasses you. You are the
embrace of life, a perfect extension of limitless love. You are
unlimited consciousness, a purity that manifests as life. You are love
without beginning or end.

<div markdown="1" class="statement over-indent">

There is no place where you are not.<br>
No time when you are not.<br>
No water that does not know you.<br>
No bird that does not sing to you.<br>
No sweetness not one with you.<br>
No beauty that does not belong to you.<br>
No holiness alien to you.

Where the wind flies, there you and I are.<br>
Where stillness envelops everything, there you and I dwell.<br>
Where the light of our glory shines, there you and I dance.<br>
Where tenderness dwells, there our voices sing.<br>
Where the horizon joins the infinite, there you and I live<br>
<span class="over-indent">forever embraced.</span>

In the waters of life, we are the joy of love.<br>
In the light of Heaven, we are the voice of truth.<br>
In the wind of spirit, we are eternity.<br>
In the history of humankind, we are the face of love.<br>
In the song of birds, we are the eternal beauty.<br>
In the lilies of the field, we are the wisdom of creation.<br>
In the union of our hearts, we are the light of the world.<br>
United we are the reality of love.

## IV. Forever Extension

One reason it has been so hard to arrive at the point where you finally
know who you are, including your unfathomable mystery, is because you
are an extension.

You were created in the likeness of God. God, being love, is eternal
extension. The same is true for you. What extends forever cannot be
static. You are a being eternally extending; that is the reality of your
identity.

Integrating manifested with unmanifested reality is to return to unity.
This applies also to your sisters and brothers, as well as to creation,
the world, and God. Remember: attributeless love manifests by being
known and shared.

Sharing your being does not mean losing it by giving it to another. Your
being cannot be used, it can only serve. Therefore, to share is to serve
love. Service is the highest aspect you can reach in your flight,
because it is in itself the reality of God. The Creator serves creation,
as much as creation serves the Creator.

In what sense do the Creator and the created serve each other in a
continuous reciprocal flow of love and truth? In the sense that if the
Creator did not create, there would be nothing, and if creation did not
have a Creator, it would be a creation without cause and therefore
without meaning. Both give meaning to each other. Since love is the
source of meaning, and both provide love reciprocally, the being you are
is a meaningful being. You have purpose which you literally feel.

God creates beings with meaning. Lack of purpose is so alien to the
truth that the mere idea of a meaningless life engenders fear. As we
said, the basic fear from which other fears arose was the fear of
yourself; and joined with the fact that you are also a mystery, what is
revealed is a relationship between knowing that your life has a
transcendent purpose and the reality of love.

Love is felt as much as reason, for they are a unit. Love not only gives
meaning to life but is in itself the purpose and reason for existence.
Love, reason, and meaning are a unity. Therefore, if you want your life
to have real purpose, you must live it in the reality of love. This is
why, despite everything, love still reigns in hearts. There is nothing
that can remove love. Fear cannot usurp the throne of love because fear
is meaningless, which is why we have treated it as madness. As already
said, what does not belong to reason cannot be real because it has no
purpose. Without purpose, there is no reason for it to be created.

Love and reason go together.

From now on you will become increasingly aware of the meaning of your
existence. You exist, not only because you make sense of God, but
because you are His purpose. You are, literally, the reason for your
divinity. If you did not exist, the purpose of the Creator would be
truncated. It is as simple as that.

God, being perfect knowledge, extended to you as an act of sharing what
is in order to know Himself. You need to do the same in order to be
complete. There is no other way to do so than to remain in union with
the love that I am, since only I can make us extend together forever. I
am not only your identity, in the sense that I am what you are, but I am
the power of love. I am what you are, and the force that exists in your
being to be as God created you to be. This is why within our union lies
the capacity and the accomplishment that the will of God be fully
realized. Put simply, I am the fullness of love.

To be full is the proper nature of being, as is abundance and the wisdom
of God. So when you extend, what you are doing is knowing your fullness.
To give yourself entirely does not entail sacrifice or the performance
of monumental works. It is not your function to determine how you
extend, for the extension of love is not something you do; it is your
reality.

Just as we had to travel a path before you could accept that not only
did you want to love and be loved, but also you are the love that your
heart longed for and the truth that your mind was looking for, now we
come to the moment when you accept that you are an eternal extension of
love, always in movement, always alive, always new.

Extending eternally what you are means that you cannot limit the purpose
of your existence. This is the same as saying that every day you are
reborn in the reality of love. Therefore, the expression of your being
will be something so broad, so novel, so clad in mystery, and at the
same time so concrete and real, that it will be in itself the
manifestation of the union of Heaven and Earth. A manifestation of both
what is mystery in you and what is knowable in you. This is how you
bring love to the world, holiness to the body, and truth to the mind.

When you feel that you have reached a port where you wish to remain as a
place of final arrival, start preparing to leave it and to embark on a
new journey. Life does not have a final arrival point. Love has no end
because it has no beginning. The beautiful flow of love that your
heart longs to follow and your mind implores to accompany cannot be
stuck in a particular form of expression.

Your dreams of greatness are justified. Your desire for elevation
makes sense because it comes from the force of truth. Your desire to
create a happy world, to live a life in ever-increasing plenitude where
you experience the joy of being alive and increasing bliss, is in
perfect harmony with the will of God. It is what your being is.

Always keep your head up. Look at the light beyond the sun. Contemplate
the beauty beyond the moon and stars. Extend your thoughts to the mind
of God. Stretch your imagination towards the unimaginable. Always create
new realities of love without limits, without structures. Do it with
love only for the sake of love. Thus you will become one with the
extension of my divine being, the power of the expression of love.

Join the movement of my spirit. Let us spread truth together. My spirit
is like the wind that always blows. My spirit is a breath of living love
which goes where it wants freely. It comes from where no one can know
because it is eternity, traveling the roads of the world, sowing peace
and love. It is the wind of life renewing the face of the Earth. In its
softness lies its truth. In its strength is love. The heart that
receives it sings a new song. The mind that joins it becomes truth and
holiness.

Stay in me. I am the extension of triune love.
