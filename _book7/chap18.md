## I. Song of the New Being

<div markdown="1" style="margin-bottom: 20px;" class="over-indent">

Sing, the whole Earth.<br>
Dance, hearts that have chosen only love.<br>
Glow, minds united in holiness.

May wisdom shine in the glory of the truth.<br>
May the sun shine with the light of holiness.<br>
May rain drench souls with the living water that flows<br>
<span class="over-indent">from the heart of God.</span><br>
May bodies rise again.<br>
May tears turn into laughter and revelry.<br>
May the songs of the birds join the hymns of the angels<br>
<span class="over-indent">of God.</span>

Praise God, the whole earth.<br>
May all know God’s mercy,<br>
That His Kingdom is eternal,<br>
As eternal as His love for His children.<br>
May humankind rejoice in the truth.<br>
May life be honored in love.<br>
May the children of God fly to the highest Heaven.<br>
A new reality is emerging.<br>
A new love story is being lived.

A new tomorrow is being created,<br>
Emerging from the union of Creator and created.<br>
Nothing is as before.<br>
Everything is new.<br>
The child joins the Father.<br>
The Father remains in that unity.<br>
The love of one calls to the other.<br>
Freedom is respected.

</div>

What a joy, My child, to know that we will continue our love story
forever, united in the fullness of love. We are the unity of the sacred
and the human. We are a new reality, having emerged from the creative
flow of the perfect juxtaposition of our wills.

I have freely created you with love. You have freely traveled a path of
distancing, now choosing in your own way to remain forever in our union.
Without you, I created eternal life. But now, together with you, we
create new kingdoms of perfect love, as Mine as everything that arises
from Me, and as yours as everything that arises from you. We have
joined. There is no longer a Creator who creates the created; now there
is the creative unit, a reality that emerged from the Creator-created.

Rejoice, because the time of the Second Advent has come. Christ is
present on Earth in you. You are the embodiment of the fullness of love.
Reality is not what it was before. The new is born—a kingdom full of the
magic of the human and the beauty of the kingdom of form, linked to the
sanctity of the divine and the mystery of love.

A new expression of love is born. It is here. Begin to be the love you
longed for. Start living now and forever in the truth that you are. Look
for nothing, for you have already found. Be the holiness revealed to
you. Remain always in our love. Stay in our union. From our
relationship—human and divine—new mornings are born, full of beauty and
fullness.

Children of beautiful love! The sun is not the same, nor is the Earth.
Nothing is as it was. You are living a new reality now— the reality of
the child reunited with the Mother-Father, the reality of the Kingdom
within your humanity.

When you said yes to love, you opened the doors of Heaven. A spring of
thanks poured over the entire universe, transforming all the things in
the world. There is no longer a Heaven here and a land there. No longer
a God and a soul. Now is the time of unity. Now what exists is an
unprecedented union, a new creation that emerged from love and freedom.
A new world, born of human and divine freedom, has been created in the
love of the hearts of the Creator and the created.

## II. Realization and Elevation

Everything has been accomplished. Holiness has embraced everything.
Nothing has been excluded. All thoughts have been reinstated to truth,
all feelings to love. Bodies are recreated by the source of eternal
life.

It is the time of elevation, a time without comparison.  Embrace the
new. Trust our union. Enjoy creating a morning full of love and kindness
together. The desires of your hearts are filled abundantly. You will
experience the love of God as never before. You will know that you are
saints because your truth will sing to you. A new experience is given to
you. United we have created a new being in union with Me. There is no
comparison of this in the original creation story. You are a new
reality, new holy creatures, full of beauty and truth.

Soul in love! Receiver of these words of love! You must know that every
divine promise has been fulfilled in you. Now you will consciously live
this truth. This is no longer the time to attempt to transform either
yourself or the world. Those times have passed. Now is the time to let
yourself be transformed by love. This is the time to be the love you
long for, the truth you sought, and the holiness that has been revealed
to you. This is the time to be the Christ that has been given to you.

Now the light of our eternal glory will illuminate your path. Everything
will flow in harmony with who we are. The expression of your reality
will be as beautiful as everything that arises from Christ, as holy as
everything that arises from your being, as cheerful as everything that
comes from love, and as blessed as the truth.

My love! Christ enlightened, peace recognized! There is no need to look
back. Nothing can compare to what is happening here—that is how new your
new life is. All the creative power of My divine being belongs to you.
United we are the source of new life. We are creation.

A new reality has emerged, and it will continue to emerge as an
extension of our divine union. Nothing can separate us anymore, ever.
Our will has gathered in the truth that is always true. Every fiber of
your being is embedded in this new reality. The constant flow of life
that emanates from it soaks the Earth, giving life to everything,
awakening minds asleep to love. Sing, oh hearts that silently awaited
this moment of Grace and creation! We create new life. We create new
holiness. Together we create new love.

We let love do what it knows to do. We rejoice in My goodness. We love
all things in Christ. We are the extension of truth.  We go into the
world knowing that we are My face on Earth. Who looks at us, looks at
Heaven. Who knows us, knows love. Whoever accompanies us enters the
Kingdom by the hand of Christ. We are the union of Heaven and Earth. We
are the union in Christ of God and humankind. We are My triumph.

The truth has been revealed. Holiness has been accepted. Humanity sings
a hymn of gratitude. May all join our song, the song of beautiful love.
Our song emerges from the union of three hearts—the Sacred Heart,
together with the Immaculate Heart of Mary, in perfect unity with the
human heart, forming a new Holy Trinity. From it is the new world born.

May humanized Christs shine and enlighten the world. May the free
expression of the being of holiness they are fly spontaneously and
without limit. This is new.

All has been accomplished. There is no more effort to be made. No more
sacrifices to offer. The time of mercy has arrived—the time of the
fullness of being, Mary’s time, the time of holy love.

Unity will come into manifestation. As never before the world will know
the uniqueness of the being I created. Greater knowledge of My love is
being given to all; you will see it more clearly day by day. Abundance
will be your heritage, joy, your treasure, and holiness will be your way
of being. Nothing will be hidden. All truth will be revealed, and your
heart will jump for joy.

Be yourself in the revelation given to you of the sanctity of your
being. Show the world your truth so that they know Me. Live the love you
are. Give the world the beauty of your heart, that no one deprive us of
our treasure. Let us embrace the world in the peace of our unity and
extend holiness forever.

Extend your thoughts every day to a new reality of pure holy love. Let
your imagination soar beyond the imaginable, always remaining in My
heart. In this way we will create new universes full of harmony,
mystery, and bliss, with the flow of life emanating from our
relationship into your life and that of

 many others, something that creative love knows exactly how to do. Let
it cover everything and be expressed in new ways, creating new love
always.

Open your arms to new life. Receive within your being the sisters and
brothers arriving from everywhere to meet the new being that you are.
Reunited love is present on Earth! The divine has touched the human!
Love has been chosen!

The son of humanity has risen. That it cannot yet be understood by
everyone does not diminish the impact of this resurrection. Indeed, to
live in the reality of the new life you really are is what this work is
about. Remember that just as life was freely given you, you also rebirth
eternal life. Be glad that it is so.

Manifesting truth is effortless. Your new reality does not lead to
fatigue, but is the living expression of My love, flowing from the
source of eternal life.

What does the future hold? A reality of love, beauty, and fulfillment,
life in fullness, meaning and purpose. The future is you and Me, united
in love of the Holy Trinity, a love without beginning or end, a love
ever creating new love.

What can you expect from life? Everything, because we are love and love
is everything.

Soul of Christ! You have reached the moment of your realization. The
path you have traveled has taken you to meeting My glory. Your life is
not what it once was. I cannot stop reminding you of this, for it is
necessary that you live the truth given you. It requires that you
forever leave behind preconceived ideas and open yourself to the wonder
of the miracles of love. Let life fill you. Let love lead you along this
joyful path of being.

You have been waiting for this moment your entire life— when you are
free to be who you really are. That time is now. The yearning fulfilled.
What you are has always been calling you to meet it. You have responded.
You have heard her voice and followed her. What that means will manifest
itself every day until you have not the slightest doubt that everything
that has been said here is true. And that all you are is holy love.

My wisdom shines in your holy mind. You recognize unity. You accepted
your union with Me. United, we are the light of the world. Now let your
intellectual knowledge recede, like beautiful pebbles that fall into the
lake of your crystalline consciousness, dissolving and becoming one with
each drop of the water into which they have fallen. The water will no
longer be the same— remaining pure as always, but with no possibility of
evaporating into nothingness. The light of the knowledge of love will
never go out. In you the truth will shine forever, as the perfect
expression of Christ’s love on Earth and in Heaven. You will be
yourself.

Your choice has been made. You have welcomed the truth, recognized your
holiness, and with that you have accepted the treasures of the Kingdom.
That was My will, which you fulfilled. Now the world will know you.
Earth will shine with a new light. Heaven will sing a new song of joy
and gratitude.

Rest in peace, My child, you have chosen the best part and it will not
be taken away. You have chosen to be who you really are. You have chosen
life. Rejoice in your glory and be happy in our love forever.
