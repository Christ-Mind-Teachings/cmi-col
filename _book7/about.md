<p>
  Born in 1968, Sebastián Blaksley is a native of Buenos Aires, Argentina, born
  into a large traditional Catholic family. He attended the Colegio del Salvador,
  a Jesuit school of which the headmaster was Jorge Bergoglio, the current Pope
  Francis. Although he wanted to be a monk as a young man, his family did not
  consider it accept-able, and the inner voice that he always obeyed let him
  know that: “You must be in the world, without being of the world.” He studied
  Business Administration in Buenos Aires and completed his postgraduate studies
  in the U.S. He held several highly respon-sible positions in well-known
  international corporations, living and working in the U.S., England, China, and
  Panama. He then founded a corporate consulting firm in Argentina that he led
  for 10 years. Sebastián has two daughters with his former wife.

  At the age of six, Sebastián was involved in a near-fatal accident during
  which he heard a voice, which later identified itself as Jesus. Ever since he
  has continued to hear that voice. Sebastián says: “Since I can remember, I have
  felt the call of Jesus and Mary to live abandoned to their will. I am devoted
  to my Catholic faith.”

  In 2013, he began to record messages from his mystical experiences.
  In 2016 he miraculously discovered A Course of Love and felt the call to devote
  himself to bringing it to the Spanish-speaking world. He also now receives,
  transcribes, and shares what the voice of Christ—the voice of love—dictates.
  Most recently he has received *Choose Only Love*, a series of seven books.

  through which he shares <em>A Course of Love</em>.
